# face-mask-detection
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. I had to create a Deep learning application that detects Whether the person is wearing a mask or not!

- For Deep Learning Model – I used <u>Tensorflow, Keras API, ResNet Application</u>.
- For Interaction – I used <u>OpenCV</u>.
- For Interface – I used <u>Flask, Dash Plotly</u>.
- For Clouding – I used <u>AWS</u>.
- For Platform – I worked Over <u>Google Colab</u>.
